GoCart

The Basics

We created GoCart to be a simple e-commerce platform that any developer can pick up and begin customizing quickly and with as little headache as possible. 

Installing GoCart

Download the zip file or clone the repository into your public html folder. You may place the files in your web root or in a subfolder.

Browse to the web address where you just copied the files. When you first load the GoCart application, you will be presented with the installer form. 

You will need to create a database and login credentials separately before installing. GoCart will not create a database for you.

In the installer form, fill in your database details, admin login details, and store address information. The installer will populate the database and create the administrator account.

From there, you can log in and begin adding your content!

Setting Up Store Content

Start with top level categories, then add in children, using the parent level category field to delineate hierarchy. 

Specify the URL using the slug field, example: mysite.com/{slug}
